# Progress report Werner - 11:05 - 13:45

We managed to make a good amount of progress. We set up the github repositories, got everyones toolchains setup and structured a rough App layout in penpot.

Various flows have been considered and most of the UI should be ready to implement.

Branch Protection for the main repo has been set up.

We also looked at the OpenCollective API and in theory most of what we need is supported.

The lack of a delete endpoint for projects is a bit concerning tho.
